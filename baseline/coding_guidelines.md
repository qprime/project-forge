# Python Coding Guidelines

**Status:** Living Document

Guidelines for writing consistent, correct, and maintainable Python code. Derived from production experience. Applicable to any Python project.

---

## 1. Immutability by Default

### Frozen Dataclasses

All core data structures should be frozen dataclasses. Immutability prevents an entire class of bugs where shared state is accidentally modified.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Measurement:
    width_mm: float
    height_mm: float
```

**Modify with `replace()`, never mutation:**

```python
# Wrong
item.width_mm = 100

# Right
new_item = replace(item, width_mm=100)
```

### Nested Structures

Frozen dataclasses only enforce shallow immutability. Nested dicts and lists remain technically mutable. Treat them as immutable anyway — always create new collections instead of modifying in place.

```python
# Wrong
item.metadata["processed"] = True

# Right
new_item = replace(item, metadata={**item.metadata, "processed": True})
```

### Tuple Collections

Use tuples instead of lists for collections that represent structural data. Tuples signal immutability and prevent accidental append/remove/sort operations.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Layout:
    items: tuple[Item, ...]        # not list[Item]
    boundaries: tuple[Point, ...]  # not list[Point]
```

---

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

### Strict Layer Separation

If your system transforms data through multiple stages, keep those stages separate. Each layer has a single responsibility and a well-defined contract with adjacent layers.

```python
# Wrong — mixing layers
def build_and_export(raw_input):
    model = parse(raw_input)
    output = render(model)  # skipped validation
    return model

# Right — each stage is distinct
model = parse(raw_input)
validated = validate(model)
output = render(validated)
```

### Intermediate Representations

Use an explicit intermediate representation (IR) as the validation checkpoint between parsing and output generation. The IR describes *what* to do, not *how* to do it.

Benefits:
- Validation happens once, in one place
- Multiple backends can consume the same IR
- Tests target the IR (fast, focused) rather than the full pipeline (slow, brittle)

### No Pass-Through of Computed Data

Semantic data structures describe *what*, not *how*. Don't thread implementation details (computed geometry, backend-specific offsets, rendering hints) through semantic layers. Compute those details in the adapter between layers.

```python
# Wrong — threading computed data through semantic layer
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Feature:
    name: str
    computed_offset: float  # implementation detail leaking into semantic layer

# Right — semantic layer stays clean
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Feature:
    name: str
    position: float  # semantic, not computed

# Adapter computes implementation details from semantic fields
def feature_to_backend_input(feature: Feature) -> BackendInput:
    offset = compute_offset(feature.position)
    return BackendInput(offset=offset)
```

### Determinism

Same input must always produce the same output. No hidden state, no randomness without explicit seeds, no dependency on dict ordering (before Python 3.7) or floating-point platform differences.

---

## 3. Function Purity

### Pure Transformations

Functions that transform data should be pure: same input produces same output, no side effects, no mutation of inputs.

```python
# Wrong — mutates input
def process(domain: Domain) -> list[Item]:
    domain.metadata["processed"] = True
    return items

# Right — input is read-only
def process(domain: Domain) -> list[Item]:
    # domain is never modified
    return items
```

### Return Types

Operations that can produce zero, one, or many results should always return a collection, never a single item. This handles all cases uniformly.

```python
# Wrong — special-cases single result
def split(region: Region) -> Region | list[Region]:
    ...

# Right — always returns collection
def split(region: Region) -> list[Region]:
    ...
```

---

## 4. Error Handling

### Error Philosophy

| Category | Behavior | Use When |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Hard error | Raise exception | Invalid input, constraint violation |
| Soft failure | Return empty + flag | Optional operation, absence acceptable |
| Never allowed | Silent partial output | — |

### Error Message Format

Error messages must include four parts:

1. **What failed** — the class or subsystem
2. **What field** — the specific parameter
3. **What constraint was violated** — the rule that was broken
4. **Actual value** — what was received

```python
# Wrong
raise ValueError("invalid width")

# Right
raise ValueError("SheetConfig: width_mm must be > 0, got -3.5")
```

If the error maps to a documented invariant:

```python
raise ValueError("Joint at position 150mm aligns with adjacent layer (BM-9 violation)")
```

### No Silent Drops

Unsupported features or unrecognized inputs must error or warn — never silently pass. Silent partial output is the hardest class of bug to diagnose.

```python
# Wrong — silently ignores unknown constraint
if constraint.type in SUPPORTED:
    apply(constraint)
# (unknown constraints silently skipped)

# Right — explicit about what's not supported
if constraint.type not in SUPPORTED:
    warnings.warn(f"Constraint {constraint.type} not implemented, skipping")
```

---

## 5. Data Structure Design

### Flat Type Systems

Prefer flat, data-driven type systems over deep class hierarchies. Use a type tag + data dict instead of a class per variant. This is extensible without new classes and serializes naturally.

```python
# Wrong — class per variant
class Rectangle:
    width: float
    height: float

class Circle:
    radius: float

# Right — flat, data-driven (when variants share the same pipeline)
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Item:
    type: str                        # "rect", "circle", etc.
    data: dict[str, Any]             # {"width": 100, "height": 50}
```

**When to use typed dataclasses instead:** Typed dataclasses are appropriate in higher-level compositional layers (where the code constructs and pattern-matches on specific shapes) and in rendering/output layers (where shape identity matters for dispatch). The flat approach works best for intermediate representations that need extensibility without code changes.

### Propagation via Params

When parent nodes need to pass context to children, use a params dict rather than special-casing child types.

```python
# Wrong — parent special-cases child types
for child in node.children:
    if isinstance(child, SpecialChild):
        handle_special(child, extra_context)
    else:
        handle_generic(child)

# Right — all children receive the same context
child_params = {**params, "context": extra_context}
for child in node.children:
    handle(child, child_params)
```

Children decide whether to consume the context. Parents don't need to know what children need.

---

## 6. Testing

### Test at the Right Level

Test against your intermediate representation, not the full pipeline output. IR-level tests are fast, focused, and don't depend on output format details.

```python
# Wrong — testing final output format
output = full_pipeline(input)
assert "expected_string" in output

# Right — testing semantic correctness
model = parse_and_validate(input)
assert model.items[0].width == 100
```

Full pipeline tests exist for integration/golden testing. Unit tests should target the layer where the logic lives.

### Test Project Code, Not the Language

Don't write tests for behavior guaranteed by Python itself.

```python
# Wrong — tests Python's @dataclass, not project code
def test_frozen():
    spec = Config(value=10)
    with pytest.raises(FrozenInstanceError):
        spec.value = 20

def test_equality():
    assert Config(value=5) == Config(value=5)

def test_replace():
    modified = replace(Config(value=10), value=20)
    assert modified.value == 20
```

Test construction only when the dataclass has custom `__post_init__` validation. Test behavior the project implements.

### No Duplicate Coverage

Before creating a new test file, check if existing tests already cover the same functions. Two test files testing the same function with the same inputs is a defect, not defense in depth.

### Semantic Equivalence in Round-Trip Tests

When testing serialization round-trips, assert on semantic equivalence, not syntax preservation. Whitespace, key order, and formatting may change.

```python
# Wrong
assert serialize(parse(input_text)) == input_text

# Right
assert parse(serialize(model)) == model
```

### Use the Test Framework

Tests are discovered by pytest (or your project's framework). Don't add:

- `if __name__ == "__main__":` runner blocks
- `print("PASS")` / `print("FAIL")` reporting
- `return True` from test functions
- `sys.path` manipulation

These are dead code in a framework-collected suite and mislead future contributors into copying the pattern.

### Expensive Iteration

If your test suite iterates over a large fixture set (all examples, all configs), limit this to one test per validation concern. If a higher-level test already runs the full set, don't add redundant loops.

---

## 7. Coordinate and Unit Discipline

### Single Unit System

Pick one unit and use it everywhere. No runtime conversions, no mixed units, no unit suffixes on variable names (unless disambiguating at system boundaries).

```python
# Wrong — mixed units
width_inches = 4.0
width_mm = width_inches * 25.4

# Right — one unit throughout
width_mm = 101.6
```

If your system needs to accept external input in different units, convert at the boundary and never again internally.

### Coordinate Spaces

Define and document your coordinate system explicitly. When multiple coordinate spaces exist (local, world, screen), name them and document the transforms between them.

Rules:
- Internal code operates in one canonical coordinate space
- Transforms happen at well-defined boundaries (import, export, rendering)
- Never apply the same transform twice — track what space data is in

```python
# Wrong — margin applied in internal computation AND at export
item_x = margin + offset  # internal
export_x = margin + item_x  # double margin

# Right — internal coordinates are pure; transform at export
item_x = offset  # working-area space
export_x = margin + item_x  # transform once at export
```

---

## 8. Defaults and Configuration

### Document Defaults

Maintain a single reference for all default values, including where they're defined and what they mean. When defaults appear in multiple locations, they must agree.

### Changing Defaults

Changes to defaults affect all consumers that rely on implicit values. When changing a default:
- Check all call sites that rely on the implicit value
- Document the change in the commit message
- Consider whether existing saved configurations need migration

### Policy vs Invariant

Distinguish between values that are policy (can change with care) and values that are invariants (changing breaks the system). Label them explicitly.

---

## 9. Validation

### Validate at Construction

Constraints on data structures should be enforced at construction time, not checked later.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Box:
    width: float
    height: float

    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.width <= 0:
            raise ValueError(f"Box: width must be > 0, got {self.width}")
        if self.height <= 0:
            raise ValueError(f"Box: height must be > 0, got {self.height}")
```

### Validate at Boundaries

Validate data at system boundaries: user input, file parsing, API responses, database reads. Internal code can trust validated data — don't re-validate at every function call.

### Constraint Auditing

When your system processes constraints or configuration, emit an audit summary showing what was honored, what was ignored, and what isn't implemented yet. This makes "it silently didn't work" impossible.

---

## 10. Invariant Management

### What Invariants Are

An invariant is a rule that, if violated, breaks the system's correctness guarantees. Invariants are not style preferences — they are load-bearing contracts.

### Classify Invariants

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| HARD | Violation breaks the system |
| STRUCTURAL | Requires coordinated migration across multiple files to change |
| POLICY | Current default, can change with care |
| FALLBACK | Defensive behavior that signals an upstream bug |

### Document Invariants Per Subsystem

Each subsystem should have a document listing its invariants with IDs, types, and descriptions. Before modifying a subsystem, read its invariants.

### Amendment Process

If a new feature needs to violate an invariant:

1. **Stop** — do not work around it locally
2. Determine if the invariant is wrong or the feature design is wrong
3. If the invariant needs to change, amend the invariant document explicitly
4. Code changes and invariant changes must be in the same commit

Invariant violations are design bugs, not implementation bugs.

### Regression Traps

Document patterns that look like improvements but break the system. Common traps for AI-assisted development:

| Trap | Why It's Wrong |
|------|----------------|
| Adding class hierarchies for variants | Flat type + data dict is intentionally extensible |
| Shortcutting pipeline layers | The IR layer exists for validation, not bureaucracy |
| Preserving syntax instead of semantics | Only AST equality matters in round-trips |
| Mutating inputs for "efficiency" | Shared state corruption |
| Threading computed data through semantic layers | Violates layer separation |

---

## 11. Code Style

### Self-Documenting Code

Write code that communicates intent through naming, structure, and type signatures. Comments should be rare — reserved for explaining *why*, never *what*. If code needs a comment to explain what it does, rename things until it doesn't.

### No Dead Code

Don't leave commented-out code, unused imports, backward-compatibility shims for removed features, or `# removed` markers. If something is unused, delete it. Version control remembers.

### Named Constants

All magic numbers and layout values should be named module-level constants. Inline literals make code harder to maintain and produce inconsistencies when the same value appears in multiple places.

```python
# Wrong
if margin < 10.0:
    ...

# Right
MIN_MARGIN_MM = 10.0
if margin < MIN_MARGIN_MM:
    ...
```

### Minimal Changes

Only change what's directly needed. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A feature doesn't need extra configurability. Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't write or change.

---

## 12. Output and Serialization

### Deterministic Output

Same input must produce byte-identical output. This enables golden file testing, reproducible builds, and meaningful diffs.

### Single Conversion Path

For any given input→output transformation, maintain exactly one code path. Multiple paths for the same conversion inevitably diverge and produce inconsistent results.

### Valid Output

Output must always be valid according to its format specification. Malformed output is a bug, not a "the consumer should handle it" situation.

---

## 13. Feature Completeness

### End-to-End Coverage

A feature isn't done when the implementation works. It's done when:

1. The core logic is implemented
2. The input format supports it (parser, schema, API)
3. Validation covers it
4. It's documented in the syntax/API reference
5. An example or recipe demonstrates usage

Partial implementation — logic without input support, or input support without validation — is tech debt that accumulates silently.

### Declarative Input First

If your system accepts user-facing input, the input format should be declarative — describing *what*, not *how*. If a feature requires users to write code (scripts, hooks, custom classes) to achieve something that should be expressible declaratively, the input format is incomplete.

---

## 14. Safety-Critical Constraints

When your system has constraints where violation causes real harm (data loss, hardware damage, security breach), those constraints get special treatment:

- **Hard error on violation** — never warn-and-continue
- **Post-execution verification** — check that the output respects the constraint, don't just trust the generation logic
- **Labeled in invariants** — mark the safety level explicitly so future maintainers understand the stakes

---

## 15. Dependency Direction

### Imports Flow Downward

Lower layers must not import from higher layers. If your validation layer imports from your renderer, or your data model imports from your CLI, the dependency is inverted.

```
Input/CLI  →  Parser  →  IR/Model  →  Validation  →  Backend/Output
   ↓            ↓           ↓             ↓               ↓
 (each layer may import from layers to its right, never to its left)
```

### Enforcing Direction

A practical test: if you delete a higher-level module, lower-level modules should still import cleanly. If removing your CLI breaks your data model, you have a circular dependency.

### Adapter Pattern

When a higher layer's types are needed by a lower layer, introduce an adapter at the boundary rather than pulling the higher layer's imports downward.

```python
# Wrong — model imports from renderer
from renderer.types import RenderHint

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Feature:
    render_hint: RenderHint  # model depends on renderer

# Right — adapter converts at the boundary
# model.py
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Feature:
    style: str  # generic, no renderer dependency

# adapter.py
from model import Feature
from renderer.types import RenderHint

def feature_to_render_hint(feature: Feature) -> RenderHint:
    return STYLE_MAP[feature.style]
```

---

## 16. Enums vs String Literals

### Closed Sets Use Enums

When the set of valid values is known and fixed, use an Enum. Enums catch typos at import time, enable IDE autocomplete, and make the valid set discoverable.

```python
# Wrong — stringly typed
def set_mode(mode: str):
    if mode == "fast":  # typo "fats" would silently fail
        ...

# Right — closed set
class Mode(Enum):
    FAST = auto()
    SAFE = auto()
    DRY_RUN = auto()

def set_mode(mode: Mode):
    ...
```

### Open Sets Use Strings

When the set of values is extensible without code changes (shape types in a flat IR, plugin names, user-defined tags), strings are appropriate. The extensibility is the point — new values shouldn't require new code.

### The Decision Rule

| Question | Answer | Use |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Can a new value be added without changing Python code? | Yes | `str` |
| Adding a new value requires a new code path? | Yes | `Enum` |
| Is the set defined by external data (config, schema)? | Yes | `str` |
| Is the set defined by the program's logic? | Yes | `Enum` |

---

## 17. Union Types and Exhaustiveness

### Explicit Unions for Variant Types

When a value can be one of several concrete types, define the union explicitly.

```python
FaceFeature = DrillHole | SquareMortise | CarvedDesign | GeometricPattern
```

### Handle Every Variant

Match/if-else chains over union types must handle every variant. Adding a new variant to the union should cause visible failures, not silent fallthrough.

```python
# Wrong — silent fallthrough on new variant
def process(feature: FaceFeature) -> Output:
    if isinstance(feature, DrillHole):
        return process_hole(feature)
    elif isinstance(feature, SquareMortise):
        return process_mortise(feature)
    # CarvedDesign silently returns None

# Right — exhaustive with explicit failure
def process(feature: FaceFeature) -> Output:
    if isinstance(feature, DrillHole):
        return process_hole(feature)
    elif isinstance(feature, SquareMortise):
        return process_mortise(feature)
    elif isinstance(feature, CarvedDesign):
        return process_carving(feature)
    elif isinstance(feature, GeometricPattern):
        return process_pattern(feature)
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unhandled feature type: {type(feature).__name__}")
```

### The Else Clause

Always include a final `else` that raises `TypeError` with the unexpected type name. This turns silent bugs into immediate, diagnosable failures when a new variant is added.

For `match` statements, use a wildcard case with the same pattern:

```python
match feature:
    case DrillHole():
        ...
    case SquareMortise():
        ...
    case _:
        raise TypeError(f"Unhandled feature type: {type(feature).__name__}")
```

---

## 18. Logging and Diagnostics

### print() Is for Debugging, Not Production

`print()` is a temporary debugging tool. It should never appear in committed code. If you need runtime diagnostics, use the `logging` module.

```python
# Wrong — print in production code
def process(items):
    print(f"Processing {len(items)} items")
    for item in items:
        print(f"  item: {item.name}")
    return results

# Right — structured logging
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def process(items):
    logger.info("Processing %d items", len(items))
    for item in items:
        logger.debug("Processing item: %s", item.name)
    return results
```

### Why Logging Over Print

| Concern | `print()` | `logging` |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Can be silenced | No (without redirecting stdout) | Yes (level filtering) |
| Shows source location | No | Yes (formatter) |
| Configurable per-module | No | Yes |
| Can route to files, services | No (without plumbing) | Yes (handlers) |
| Searchable in grep | Ambiguous (`print` is everywhere) | Clear (`logger.info`, `logger.warning`) |

### Level Discipline

| Level | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| `DEBUG` | Internal state useful during development (variable values, branch taken) |
| `INFO` | High-level progress milestones ("Processing 47 items", "Export complete") |
| `WARNING` | Something unexpected but recoverable (unsupported constraint skipped, fallback used) |
| `ERROR` | Something failed but the program continues (one item in a batch failed) |
| `CRITICAL` | The program cannot continue |

Don't use `WARNING` for expected situations. Don't use `INFO` for per-item detail that floods the output. Match the level to the audience: `INFO` is for operators, `DEBUG` is for developers.

---

## 19. Exception Types

### Standard Exception Hierarchy

Use Python's built-in exceptions consistently:

| Exception | Use When |
|-----------|----------|
| `ValueError` | Value is the right type but violates a constraint (negative width, empty string, out of range) |
| `TypeError` | Value is the wrong type entirely (passed a string where an int was expected, unhandled union variant) |
| `KeyError` | Required key missing from a dict or mapping |
| `RuntimeError` | A state that "shouldn't happen" was reached (invariant violation at runtime, impossible branch) |
| `NotImplementedError` | Method exists in interface but this subclass hasn't implemented it yet |
| `FileNotFoundError` | Expected file/path doesn't exist |

### Custom Exceptions

Create custom exceptions when callers need to distinguish your errors from generic ones for recovery purposes.

```python
class ValidationError(ValueError):
    """A constraint check failed during validation."""

class PipelineError(RuntimeError):
    """An invariant was violated during pipeline execution."""
```

Don't create custom exceptions just for naming. If no caller will ever `except YourCustomError`, it doesn't need to exist — use the standard type.

### Exception Granularity

One custom base exception per subsystem is usually enough. Don't create a unique exception class for every possible error — that's a class hierarchy problem in disguise.

```python
# Wrong — exception class explosion
class WidthTooSmallError(ValidationError): ...
class HeightTooSmallError(ValidationError): ...
class DepthNegativeError(ValidationError): ...

# Right — one exception, descriptive message
raise ValidationError("Box: width must be > 0, got -3.5")
```

The error message carries the specifics. The exception type carries the category.

---

## 20. Error Semantics by Layer

### Each Layer Has Its Own Failure Mode

Not every layer should handle errors the same way. Define the failure behavior per layer and stick to it.

| Layer | On Failure | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Parser | Fail hard | Raise a parse error; malformed input is not recoverable |
| Resolver / Builder | Skip item | Catch expected-failure exceptions; continue with remaining items |
| Adapters | Warn + skip | Catch `ValueError` around each item; log warning, collect into warnings list, continue |
| Core engine / Planner | Warn + skip | Log to structured accumulator; skip individual item, continue job |
| Pipeline orchestrator | Collect + gate | Accumulate errors/warnings from all layers; halt on safety-critical failures |

The principle: failures become less fatal as you move outward. The parser is strict. The pipeline orchestrator is lenient with individual items but strict about safety constraints.

### Per-Item Isolation

In any loop that processes a collection, wrap each item in `try/except`. One bad item should never kill the batch.

```python
# Wrong — one bad item kills everything
results = []
for item in items:
    results.append(process(item))

# Right — per-item isolation
results = []
warnings = []
for item in items:
    try:
        results.append(process(item))
    except ValueError as e:
        warnings.append(f"Skipped {item.id}: {e}")
```

### Structured Warning Collection

When an item is skipped, emit both:
1. A log message (`logger.warning(...)`) for developer diagnostics
2. A structured warning (`warnings.append(msg)`) for the pipeline result

If the skip affects final output, it must reach the structured warnings — pure logging is only for internal diagnostics that don't affect correctness.

Warning messages always include: item identity, the specific problem, and the action taken ("— skipped").

---

## 21. Expected-Failure Exceptions

### The Skip Protocol

Some failures are expected and normal — not bugs. A region too small to machine, a constraint that can't be satisfied, an optional operation with no work to do. These need a dedicated exception type so callers can distinguish "expected skip" from "actual bug."

```python
class SkipError(ValueError):
    """Operation impossible for this input — expected condition, not a bug."""
```

### The Full Pattern

```python
def generate(domain, params, *, allow_empty=False):
    if domain.area < min_area(params):
        if allow_empty:
            return []
        raise SkipError(f"Domain area {domain.area} below minimum {min_area(params)}")
    return do_work(domain, params)
```

Callers choose their tolerance:
- **Strict mode** (`allow_empty=False`): raises on skip — caller must handle
- **Lenient mode** (`allow_empty=True`): returns empty — caller gets no output but no exception

The layer above always catches `SkipError` and continues. It never propagates past the immediate caller.

---

## 22. Dispatch Patterns

### Registry Dict Over If/Elif

When dispatching on a type tag or feature name, prefer a registry dict over long if/elif chains. Registries are declarative, extensible, and self-documenting.

```python
# Wrong — long if/elif chain
def handle(feature_type, data):
    if feature_type == "pocket":
        return handle_pocket(data)
    elif feature_type == "profile":
        return handle_profile(data)
    elif feature_type == "hole":
        return handle_hole(data)
    # grows forever...

# Right — registry dict
HANDLERS = {
    "pocket": handle_pocket,
    "profile": handle_profile,
    "hole": handle_hole,
}

def handle(feature_type, data):
    handler = HANDLERS.get(feature_type)
    if handler is None:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown feature type: {feature_type}")
    return handler(data)
```

### Decorator Registration

For large registries, a decorator keeps the handler and its registration co-located:

```python
HANDLERS: dict[str, Callable] = {}

def register(feature_type: str):
    def decorator(fn):
        HANDLERS[feature_type] = fn
        return fn
    return decorator

@register("pocket")
def handle_pocket(data):
    ...
```

### When If/Elif Is Fine

Short chains (2–3 branches) that are unlikely to grow don't need a registry. Don't over-engineer dispatch for simple cases. The registry pattern earns its keep at ~5+ branches or when new types are added regularly.

### Normalize Before Dispatch

If your type tags come from external input with inconsistent casing, normalize at the dispatch entry point — not inside each handler.

```python
def handle(feature_type: str, data):
    handler = HANDLERS.get(feature_type.lower())
    ...
```

---

## 23. Function Signature Conventions

### Frozen Params Objects

When a function takes more than 3 related parameters, group them into a frozen dataclass. This prevents argument-order bugs, makes the call site self-documenting, and provides a natural place for validation.

```python
# Wrong — too many positional args
def generate(width, height, depth, spacing, offset, angle):
    ...

# Right — params object
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class GridParams:
    width_mm: float
    height_mm: float
    depth_mm: float
    spacing_mm: float
    offset_mm: float = 0.0
    angle_deg: float = 0.0

def generate(domain: Domain, params: GridParams):
    ...
```

### Keyword-Only Arguments

Use `*` to force keyword-only arguments for flags and options that would be ambiguous as positional args.

```python
def generate(domain: Domain, params: GridParams, *, allow_empty: bool = False):
    ...
```

### Max Positional Parameters

A function should take at most 3 positional parameters. Beyond that, use a params object or keyword-only arguments. Long positional signatures invite argument-order bugs that the type checker can't catch.

## 24. Naming Vocabulary

### Consistent Verbs at Layer Boundaries

Use the same verb for the same operation across the codebase. When a new contributor sees `parse_`, they should know exactly what kind of operation it is.

| Verb | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `parse_*` | String/text → structured data | `parse_config`, `parse_dimension` |
| `format_*` | Structured data → string/text | `format_output`, `format_report` |
| `resolve_*` | Simplify structure, expand references | `resolve_layout`, `resolve_template` |
| `*_to_*` | Convert between typed representations | `model_to_dto`, `ast_to_ir` |
| `validate_*` | Check correctness, raise on failure | `validate_config`, `validate_bounds` |
| `build_*` | Construct complex object from parts | `build_pipeline`, `build_tool_db` |
| `load_*` | Read from disk or external source | `load_config`, `load_template` |
| `write_*` | Emit machine/file output | `write_output`, `write_report` |
| `render_*` | Emit visual/display output | `render_diagram`, `render_html` |
| `expand_*` | Parameterized instantiation | `expand_template`, `expand_macro` |

### Private Helper Prefixes

Private helpers follow the same verb conventions with underscore prefix:

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `_handle_*` | Dispatch target for a specific case |
| `_build_*` | Internal construction helper |
| `_validate_*` | Internal validation check |
| `_collect_*` / `_count_*` | Aggregation helpers |
| `_is_*` / `_has_*` | Boolean predicates |

### Why This Matters

Consistent naming eliminates guesswork. You don't search for "does it convert or transform or translate or map" — it's always `*_to_*`. You don't wonder "is it read or load or fetch" — it's always `load_*` for disk, `fetch_*` for network.

## 25. Guard Clauses and Input Normalization

### Guard Clauses at Entry

Functions validate preconditions with early `raise` before doing real work. This keeps the happy path unindented and easy to follow.

```python
# Wrong — nested conditionals
def process(items, config):
    if items:
        if config.is_valid():
            # 3 levels deep before real work starts
            for item in items:
                ...

# Right — guard clauses
def process(items, config):
    if not items:
        return []
    if not config.is_valid():
        raise ValueError(f"Config: must be valid, got {config}")
    for item in items:
        ...
```

### Normalize Before Branching

Canonicalize inputs at function entry — before any validation or dispatch logic. This prevents scattered normalization and missed cases.

```python
def handle_shape(shape_type: str, data: dict):
    shape_type = shape_type.lower().strip()
    # now all branches see normalized input
    handler = HANDLERS.get(shape_type)
    ...
```

Common normalizations:
- `.lower()` / `.strip()` for string tags
- `float()` / `int()` for numeric strings from parsed input
- `None` checks resolved to defaults

---

## 26. Collection Building

### Explicit Loops Over Comprehensions

When building collections with per-item error handling, conditional logic, or multi-step processing, use explicit loops. Comprehensions are for simple transforms.

```python
# Wrong — comprehension with try/except (not possible) or conditional that hides errors
items = [process(x) for x in inputs if can_process(x)]

# Right — explicit loop with error handling
items = []
for x in inputs:
    try:
        items.append(process(x))
    except ValueError as e:
        warnings.append(f"Skipped {x.id}: {e}")
```

Comprehensions are fine for simple, infallible transforms: `names = [item.name for item in items]`.

### Tuple at the Return Boundary

Internal accumulation uses `list` (for `.append()`). Convert to `tuple` at the return boundary when the frozen dataclass field expects it.

```python
def collect_items(source) -> tuple[Item, ...]:
    result = []  # mutable during construction
    for raw in source:
        result.append(Item.from_raw(raw))
    return tuple(result)  # frozen at return
```

### Preserve Input Order

Output order should match input order by default. If you need deduplication, use a dict keyed by identity to preserve first-seen order:

```python
seen = {}
for item in items:
    key = item.identity_key()
    if key not in seen:
        seen[key] = item
unique_items = tuple(seen.values())
```

## 27. Serialization Completeness

### Serialize All Non-Private Fields

`to_dict()` methods must serialize all non-private fields. If a field is intentionally omitted, document the omission at the serialization site explaining why. Silent omission is a data-loss bug.

```python
# Wrong — silently drops field
def to_dict(self):
    return {
        "name": self.name,
        "width": self.width,
        # height silently missing
    }

# Right — all fields present
def to_dict(self):
    return {
        "name": self.name,
        "width": self.width,
        "height": self.height,
    }
```

### Round-Trip Completeness

All fields must survive a `serialize → deserialize → serialize` round-trip. When adding a new field to a data structure, update the serializer, the deserializer, and the round-trip tests. Incomplete coverage silently drops the field.

### Non-Default Emission

Formatters should emit only non-default fields for brevity. Parsers must accept both the full and abbreviated forms. The formatter emits the simplest valid representation; the parser accepts the most permissive.

---

## 28. Nullable Numeric Parsing

### The `or` Trap

Never use `or` for nullable numeric fields where `0` is a valid value. Python's `or` treats `0`, `0.0`, and `""` as falsy, silently falling through to the alternative.

```python
# Wrong — silently replaces 0 with fallback
width = data.get("width") or default_width
# If data["width"] is 0, width becomes default_width

# Right — explicit None check
width = data.get("width")
if width is None:
    width = default_width
```

This applies to all parsed input (YAML, JSON, CLI args, database reads) where numeric fields may legitimately be zero.

### Related: Empty String

The same trap applies to string fields where empty string `""` is valid:

```python
# Wrong
label = data.get("label") or "default"  # "" becomes "default"

# Right
label = data.get("label")
if label is None:
    label = "default"
```

## 29. Type System Conventions

### Six Type Mechanisms

Python offers several ways to constrain types. Each has a specific use case — don't reach for the wrong one.

| Mechanism | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| `Enum` with `auto()` | Internal identity types (value doesn't matter) | `Role.ADMIN`, `Status.ACTIVE` |
| `Enum` with string values | Serialized or user-facing values | `Mode("fast")`, `Verdict("pass")` |
| `Literal[...]` | Inline field constraints on dataclass fields | `side: Literal["left", "right"]` |
| Constants class | String keys for dict lookup and dispatch | `class FeatureType: POCKET = "pocket"` |
| Pipe union (`A \| B`) | Sum types at module level | `Event = Click \| Hover \| Scroll` |
| `@runtime_checkable Protocol` | Structural subtyping interfaces | `class Handler(Protocol): def handle(self) -> None: ...` |

### Choosing Between Enum, Literal, and Constants

- **Enum**: When you need the value to be a first-class object with identity, iteration, and membership testing (`if role in Role`). When adding a new variant requires a new code path.
- **Literal**: When constraining a single field on a dataclass. Lighter than Enum — no import, no class. Best for 2–4 values that won't grow.
- **Constants class**: When string values are used as dict keys for dispatch or lookup. Constants are just strings with names — they don't create a type, but they prevent typos and enable IDE navigation.

### Protocol Over ABC

When defining an interface, prefer `@runtime_checkable Protocol` over `ABC`. Protocols use structural subtyping — any class with the right methods satisfies the protocol without inheriting from it. This is more Pythonic and avoids coupling through inheritance.

```python
# Prefer — structural subtyping
@runtime_checkable
class Handler(Protocol):
    def handle(self, event: Event) -> Result: ...

# Avoid (unless you need shared implementation) — nominal subtyping
class Handler(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def handle(self, event: Event) -> Result: ...
```

## 30. Dataclass Field Ordering

### Strict Field Order

Dataclass fields follow a consistent ordering convention. This makes constructors predictable and prevents `TypeError` from fields-without-defaults preceding fields-with-defaults.

1. **Required fields** (no default) — the essential identity of the object
2. **Optional typed fields** (`field: Type | None = None`) — present or absent
3. **Factory-default fields** (`field(default_factory=...)`) — complex defaults
4. **Scalar defaults** (`field: Type = value`) — simple defaults

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Feature:
    # 1. Required
    name: str
    width_mm: float
    height_mm: float

    # 2. Optional
    description: str | None = None
    parent_id: str | None = None

    # 3. Factory defaults
    tags: tuple[str, ...] = field(default_factory=tuple)
    metadata: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)

    # 4. Scalar defaults
    depth_mm: float = 1.0
    enabled: bool = True
```

### `with_*()` Helpers

When a frozen dataclass needs a common mutation pattern, provide a named helper that wraps `replace()`:

```python
def with_tags(self, *new_tags: str) -> Feature:
    return replace(self, tags=self.tags + new_tags)
```

This makes the call site readable and keeps the `replace()` boilerplate in one place.

## 31. The Amendment Culture

These guidelines are not immutable. But they can't be ignored, either. The process for change:

1. If a guideline blocks your work, **stop**
2. Determine if the guideline is wrong or your approach is wrong
3. If the guideline needs to change, change it explicitly with rationale
4. Never work around a guideline locally — that creates invisible technical debt

The goal is a codebase where every rule is either followed or explicitly amended. The worst state is a rule that exists on paper but is routinely ignored — that's worse than having no rule at all.
